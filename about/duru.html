    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Duru. I'm an exchange student from Istanbul Bilgi University, still working on my bachelors. I have worked in small scale web development projects. Graphic design is my passion and in this project I will mostly be focused on front end development. I try to keep a keen eye for aesthetics. I like to think I have a solid understanding of design principles, and proficiency in various design software. I take pride in my ability to translate concepts into captivating visuals, and I am excited about the opportunity to create not only creating a functional but a unique looking product for this project.</p>
